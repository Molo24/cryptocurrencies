Description: Unsupervised Machine Learning Concepts

## Overview & Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practice various unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as: data processing, clustering, dimension reduction and also reduce using principal components analysis (PCA).

In order to practice these concepts an analysis was conducted on the cryptocurrency market.

Tools used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, hvplot, plotly, sklearn (PCA & KMeans)

## Analysis
- Preprocess the Data for PCA
- Reduce Dimensions using PCA
- Use K-means to cluster the ctrypocurrencies
- Demonstrate the results via visualizations

## Results
Please find the accompanying ```crypto_clustering.ipynb``` for all the steps invovled in this analysis.

The two main deliverables, a final dataframe and a scatter plot are below:
